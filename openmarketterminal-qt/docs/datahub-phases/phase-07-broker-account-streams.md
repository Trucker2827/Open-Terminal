# Phase 7 — Broker Account Streams

**Status:** Not started
**Depends on:** Phase 1 (hub primitive) and Phase 4 (WebSocket producer
pattern + `coalesce_within_ms` + `active_subscriber_delta` signal).
**Nominal duration:** 1 week (3 registered adapters × moderate touch each)
**Rough size:** Medium — significant surface area, but only three equity
brokers are registered today.

---

## Goal

Unify live account data from all registered broker integrations behind a
single topic family: `broker:<id>:positions`, `broker:<id>:orders`,
`broker:<id>:balance`, `broker:<id>:ticks:<sym>`. Two accounts on the
same broker stay isolated via the multi-account topic extension
`broker:<id>:<account_id>:<channel>`.

The payoff: a user with three connections (Alpaca + IBKR + Kraken) and
two screens open (dashboard portfolio summary + equity trading
screen) gets **one** WS connection per broker/exchange, not six. Today each
screen owns its own connection; removing the duplication is one of
the largest wins in this refactor.

## Targets

### Registered equity broker adapters

Open Terminal registers **three** US equity brokers in `BrokerRegistry`:

| ID | Broker | Notes |
|----|--------|-------|
| `alpaca` | Alpaca | API key/secret; native paper + live; `AlpacaWebSocket` for market data |
| `ibkr` | Interactive Brokers | Client Portal Gateway (local); bracket orders |
| `tradier` | Tradier | Access token; live + sandbox |

Each lives under `src/trading/brokers/<broker>/`.

**Dormant adapter source (not in picker):** Saxo Bank (`saxobank`) and
MetaTrader 4 via MetaAPI (`metatrader4`) — re-enable by registering them
in `BrokerRegistry::register_all()`.

### Cross-cutting infrastructure
- `BrokerInterface` — abstract base, contract unchanged.
- `BrokerHttp` — blocking HTTP via `QEventLoop`. Memory note
  `project_broker_http_blocking.md` warns that it must be called from
  `QtConcurrent::run`. Preserved — hub producers marshal back to the
  hub thread via queued connection.
- `AccountManager`, `AccountDataStream`, `DataStreamManager` (from
  `project_multi_account.md`). Current multi-account plumbing — this
  phase refactors to publish to the hub per-account.

### Consumers
- `EquityTradingScreen` (`src/screens/equity_trading/...`) —
  positions, orders, balance panels.
- `DashboardScreen` widgets: `PortfolioSummaryWidget`,
  `QuickTradeWidget`, `RiskMetricsWidget` already get quote data
  from the hub (Phase 3); their broker-sourced parts move here.
- `PortfolioBlotter` — position rows.
- `AlgoTradingScreen` — order status.
- Multi-account selector UI.

## Deliverables

### Topic families

- `broker:<id>:positions` — TTL 5 s, poll fallback if WS not
  available. `<id>` is the canonical lower-case broker slug
  (`alpaca`, `ibkr`, `tradier`, …).
- `broker:<id>:orders` — TTL 5 s. Live order book for the account.
- `broker:<id>:balance` — TTL 30 s. Cash + margin.
- `broker:<id>:ticks:<sym>` — push-only. Per-broker market tick feed
  (Alpaca data WebSocket, IBKR gateway stream, Tradier quotes).

Multi-account extension (for users with multiple accounts on the
same broker): `broker:<id>:<account_id>:<channel>`. If a broker
supports only one account per login, we still use the long form —
`<account_id>` defaults to `default`. Single-account and
multi-account code paths are identical.

### `BrokerProducer` mixin

Add `src/trading/brokers/base/BrokerProducer.{h,cpp}`. Implements
`Producer` on behalf of a broker adapter. Responsibilities:

- `topic_patterns()` returns the four patterns for this broker's
  slug (`broker:alpaca:*`, etc.).
- `refresh(topics)` routes by channel:
  - `broker:<id>:<acct>:positions` → call
    `BrokerInterface::fetch_positions(acct)` inside
    `QtConcurrent::run` (because `BrokerHttp::execute` blocks), then
    publish the result.
  - `broker:<id>:<acct>:orders` → similar.
  - `broker:<id>:<acct>:balance` → similar.
  - `broker:<id>:<acct>:ticks:*` → **no-op**. Ticks are push-only.
- `on_topic_idle(topic)` — for tick topics, unsubscribe the symbol
  from the broker WS; for positions/orders/balance, no-op.
- On the broker's own WS message, call `hub.publish(topic, payload)`.

`BrokerProducer` subclasses — one per broker — so each broker can
override `start_tick_feed(account, symbol)` / `stop_tick_feed` in the
broker's native way (Alpaca uses JSON over WebSocket; IBKR uses the
Client Portal streaming API; Tradier falls back to REST quote polling).
The Producer base handles the hub-facing side; the subclass handles the
broker-specific protocol.

### `AccountDataStream` / `DataStreamManager` refactor

These classes currently emit Qt signals per-account. Change them to
publish per-account topics. Consumers no longer subscribe to
`AccountDataStream` signals — they subscribe to
`broker:alpaca:my_account:positions` directly.

`AccountManager` gains an `active_account_id(broker_id)` getter; the
equity trading screen uses it to build the correct topic string for
subscribe.

### Consumer migration
- `EquityTradingScreen` — three panels (positions, orders, balance)
  subscribe to their respective topics for the currently selected
  account. Account switch triggers
  `hub.unsubscribe_all(this)` + resubscribe.
- Dashboard widgets consuming broker data — same pattern.
- `AlgoTradingScreen` — subscribes to `broker:<id>:<acct>:orders`
  and pushes state changes into its order-status table.
- Multi-account selector — reads `hub.stats()` to display which
  accounts are currently streaming; no direct subscription of its
  own.

### Cross-thread marshaling audit
Every broker SDK has its own threading model (Alpaca emits on the
network thread; IBKR uses the gateway's thread pool). Every
`hub.publish(...)` call from a broker callback must be safe. The hub
guarantees this via `QueuedConnection` (Phase 1 cross-thread test
covers it). Per-broker smoke test added to verify ticks from the
broker's thread arrive on the UI.

---

## Success check

- Open EquityTradingScreen with Alpaca connected **and** dashboard
  portfolio summary visible. Log shows one active Alpaca data
  subscription, not two. `hub.stats()` for
  `broker:alpaca:default:positions` shows subscriber_count = 2.
- Connect a second Alpaca account (multi-account). Both accounts'
  positions stream independently under distinct topics; switching
  the "active account" selector swaps the visible panel without
  dropping the other account's stream (it's still alive for
  background widgets that subscribe to both).
- Every `BrokerHttp::execute` call happens inside
  `QtConcurrent::run` — no UI freeze on account switch. Verified by
  adding a temporary `Q_ASSERT(QThread::currentThread() != qApp->thread())`
  at the top of `BrokerHttp::execute` for smoke testing (removed
  before merge).
- Every registered broker adapter's smoke test: place a paper order, expect
  `broker:<id>:<acct>:orders` to publish within 2 s. Verified across
  Alpaca, IBKR, and Tradier.
- Tick feed consolidation: open CryptoWidget (Kraken via
  `ws:kraken:*`, Phase 4) alongside an Alpaca equity widget
  streaming `broker:alpaca:<acct>:ticks:AAPL`. Two distinct WS
  connections (one per broker/exchange), not four.

---

## Risk

- **Broker SDK quality varies.** Not all adapters expose clean
  first-subscriber / last-unsubscriber hooks. Mitigation: for problem
  brokers, fall back to continuous polling of `fetch_positions` etc.
  on a long interval (10 s); the hub's TTL already gates outbound calls.
- **Per-account isolation bugs.** If `<account_id>` isn't threaded
  through every code path, two accounts could collide (account B
  sees A's positions). Mitigation: mandatory account_id parameter
  in `BrokerProducer::refresh()`'s topic parse; assertion fires if
  topic lacks the account segment.
- **Credential / auth refresh races.** When a broker's auth token
  expires mid-stream, the producer must re-auth and keep the topic
  alive — not drop the subscriber. Mitigation: audit existing
  auth-refresh flow in each adapter; ensure it stays in place,
  hub-side is unaffected.
- **BrokerHttp blocking trap.** Memory `project_broker_http_blocking.md`
  calls out this sharp edge. Every hub `refresh()` call that invokes
  the broker must wrap in `QtConcurrent::run`. Mitigation: the
  `BrokerProducer::refresh()` base implementation always wraps — the
  subclass can't accidentally call blocking HTTP on the UI thread.
- **Large diff, long integration window.** Mitigation: migrate
  brokers one-by-one in separate PRs; finance-critical flows get
  extra manual testing per broker.
- **Tick coalescing on broker feeds.** High-frequency tick streams
  can deliver many updates per symbol per second. Apply
  `coalesce_within_ms = 100` on `broker:*:*:ticks:*` by default.

---

## Rollback

- **Per-broker revert.** Each broker's adapter migration is a
  separate PR; revert the broken broker, the others still work.
- **Producer-off switch.** If a broker's hub publishing misfires,
  unregister the Producer — consumers fall back to the legacy
  `AccountDataStream` signal path, which stays alive for the
  duration of this phase. Only removed in Phase 10.
- **Multi-account topic format change.** If the four-segment topic
  string turns out to be wrong (e.g. if a broker ID contains a
  colon), hub can be patched to URL-encode path segments without
  affecting subscribers — they always build topics via a helper
  `broker_topic(broker_id, account_id, channel, ...)` that
  encapsulates the format.

---

## Out of scope

- Order submission / modification flow — unchanged. Hub is for
  **reading** broker state; placing orders still goes through
  `BrokerInterface::place_order()` directly (fire-and-forget;
  result arrives via the orders topic anyway).
- Broker-specific screens beyond the generic equity/portfolio flow
  (e.g. IBKR advanced options chain) — assess per-broker in Phase
  9 or defer.
- Paper trading engine (`src/trading/PaperTrading.cpp`) — uses its own
  deterministic engine and yfinance marks; no live broker connection.
  Hub publishing for paper portfolios is a separate follow-up.
- Deleting the legacy `AccountDataStream` signal API — Phase 10.
